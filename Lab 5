//Question
;You are tasked to design and code in ATMEGA8515 assembly, a small application which counts the number 
;of trailing zeros in a one byte data. Your implementation should translate the attached TrailingZero.c
;program without any alteration to the C-Code/ algorithm provided. Furthermore, Stack Memory should 
;be used to pass ALL the parameters between the main() and the two user defined functions of the
;program. Note that the printf statements in the program are not to be translated into assembly code.

.include"m8515.inc"

;Stack frame by the caller: Arguments of function
PUSH rnumber
PUSH rans
RCALL func
POP rans
POP rnumber
